CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrpi_ws281x.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rpi_ws281x", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rpi_ws281x" with
  any of the following names:

    rpi_ws281xConfig.cmake
    rpi_ws281x-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rpi_ws281x" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rpi_ws281x_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rpi_ws281x" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
